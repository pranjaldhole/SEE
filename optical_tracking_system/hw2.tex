\chapter{Camera-based motion observation}
\section{Deliverable 4.1 - Operation of AICISS optical tracking system}
Write a short report summarizing the operation of the AICISS optical tracking system. Your report should cover:
\subsection{The relevant aspects of the design of the robot, especially how you attached the marker.}

\subsection{The method to retrieve the pose of the centre of motion of the robot}

\subsection{Documentation of the tests conducted to ensure correct operation of the system}

\subsection{An estimation of the pose measurement error based on your tests}

\section{Deliverable 4.2 - Experiment}
A written report covering your observations, including appropriate figures, diagrams and images backing up any claim you make. The report must be self-contained and provide enough details to support any statement you make. Include:
\subsection{The program and parameters used to drive the robot}

\subsection{Any observation made during the execution that may help to understand the outcome of the experiments}

\subsection{Visualisation of the obtained traces (make sure that the aspect ratio of the coordinate axes is the same)}

\subsection{The calculated uncertainties for the start and stop positions, as well as any notable characteristics of the data and a comparison of the uncertainties}

\subsection{An analysis of the data quality for the start and end poses as well as for the obtained traces}

\subsection{The observed data as an Excel or LibreOffice Calc file or in a similar machine-readable form}
