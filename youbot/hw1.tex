\chapter{youBot placing experiment}
\section{Deliverables 6.1}
\textbf{Run the complete experiment with a KUKA youBot arm, i.e. run all 180 experimental trials and perform any necessary preprocessing of the data. You should submit a written report covering your observations, including appropriate figures. Your report should include:}

\subsection{Any observations made during the execution that may help to understand the outcome of the experiments; for instance, are there any particular sources of error that may affect the results of the experiment?}


\subsection{A description of the pose filtering procedure you used and any observations that you may have made during the filtering process (e.g. on average, how many outliers are there per single experimental trial)}



\subsection{The saved preprocessed data as Excel or LibreOffice Calc file or in a similar machine-readable form}



\subsection{A visualization of the obtained final object poses. You are free to use any suitable visual representation for the data (using what you have already learned during the LEGO experiment). Hint: Given the different object-place combinations in the experiment, think about what we might want to illustrate with the visualization (e.g. the distribution of poses per object? the distribution of poses per motion direction? the distribution of all poses?)}
