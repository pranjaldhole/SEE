### Todo
#### Feedback received on 2018-05-17
- [x] Axes labels in observed data plots: x and y were undefined.
- [x] Add everything to report
- [x] Color code differences so that updated on feedback can be tracked.
- [x] Too many significant digits in observed readings.
- [x] Gaussian fits: X axes labels - add x and y with units.
- [x] Estimate the position of the robot and fit it with a Gaussian (x, y, theta)
- [x] Evaluate measurement uncertainty.

#### Note
For showing the update on feedback, use ``\update{text}`` in latex.
